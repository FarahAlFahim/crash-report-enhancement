            "The error message indicates that there are issues related to the `PacemakerConnectionException` and a subsequent `NullPointerException` in the Apache Storm framework. The `PacemakerConnectionException` suggests that there is a timeout while waiting for a channel to be ready, which could indicate network issues, misconfiguration, or problems with the Pacemaker service itself. The `NullPointerException` seems to be a consequence of the first exception, likely due to the failure to retrieve necessary data when the connection is not established.\n\nTo provide a more detailed analysis or solution, I need to look into the methods involved in the stack trace, particularly those related to `PacemakerClient`, `PaceMakerStateStorage`, and `Nimbus`. This will help identify the root cause and potential fixes.\n\nAction: Analyze and Request Next  \nAction Input: \"org.apache.storm.pacemaker.PacemakerClient.waitUntilReady\"  ",
            "I need to gather more information about the methods involved in the stack trace to understand the root cause of the exceptions better. I will request the methods one by one to analyze their functionality and how they relate to the exceptions.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: \"org.apache.storm.pacemaker.PacemakerClient.send\"  ",
            "The `send` method in the `PacemakerClient` class is responsible for sending heartbeat messages (`HBMessage`) to a channel. It first logs the message being sent and then attempts to acquire a message slot. The method waits until the channel is ready using `waitUntilReady()`, and if the channel is available, it writes the message to the channel. If the channel is not ready, it catches the `PacemakerConnectionException` and logs the error.\n\nThe method also handles the case where the response might be `null`, indicating a potential loss of connection, and attempts to resend the message. This behavior aligns with the `PacemakerConnectionException` observed in the stack trace, as it indicates that the method is trying to send messages even when the connection is not established.\n\nNext, I will analyze the `PacemakerClientPool.sendAll` method to see how it interacts with the `send` method and contributes to the overall process.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: \"org.apache.storm.pacemaker.PacemakerClientPool.sendAll\"  ",
            "The `sendAll` method in the `PacemakerClientPool` class is responsible for sending a heartbeat message (`HBMessage`) to all available servers in the `servers` list. It iterates through each server, retrieves the corresponding client using `getClientForServer(s)`, and calls the `send` method on that client to send the message. The responses from each server are collected in a list.\n\nIf no responses are received (i.e., the `responses` list is empty), the method throws a `PacemakerConnectionException`, indicating that it failed to connect to any of the Pacemaker servers. This behavior is significant because it highlights that if the `sendAll` method fails to connect to any server, it will propagate the connection exception, which is consistent with the `PacemakerConnectionException` seen in the stack trace.\n\nNext, I will analyze the `PaceMakerStateStorage.get_worker_hb_children` method to understand how it interacts with the previous methods and contributes to the exceptions.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: \"org.apache.storm.cluster.PaceMakerStateStorage.get_worker_hb_children\"  ",
            "The `get_worker_hb_children` method in the `PaceMakerStateStorage` class is responsible for retrieving heartbeat children nodes from a specified path. It constructs a heartbeat message to request all nodes for the given path and sends this message to all Pacemaker servers using the `sendAll` method from the `PacemakerClientPool`.\n\nThe method includes a retry mechanism that attempts to resend the request if a `PacemakerConnectionException` occurs. If the maximum number of retries is reached, it throws a `RuntimeException`. This method is crucial because it directly interacts with the `PacemakerClientPool` and relies on the successful sending of messages to retrieve data. If the connection to the Pacemaker servers is not established, it can lead to the `PacemakerConnectionException` observed in the stack trace.\n\nNext, I will analyze the `StormClusterStateImpl.heartbeatStorms` method to see how it interacts with the `get_worker_hb_children` method and contributes to the exceptions.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: \"org.apache.storm.cluster.StormClusterStateImpl.heartbeatStorms\"  ",
            "The `heartbeatStorms` method in the `StormClusterStateImpl` class is a straightforward method that calls the `get_worker_hb_children` method from the `PaceMakerStateStorage` class. It does not contain any additional logic or error handling; it simply acts as a wrapper to retrieve the heartbeat children nodes for the specified path.\n\nSince this method relies on `get_worker_hb_children`, any issues that arise in that method (such as the `PacemakerConnectionException`) will propagate up to this method. This means that if the connection to the Pacemaker servers is not established, it will result in the same exceptions observed in the stack trace.\n\nNext, I will analyze the `Nimbus.topoIdsToClean` method to see how it interacts with the `heartbeatStorms` method and contributes to the exceptions.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: \"org.apache.storm.daemon.nimbus.Nimbus.topoIdsToClean\"  ",
            "The method `Nimbus.topoIdsToClean` could not be found in the codebase. This might indicate that it is either not implemented, has been removed, or is located in a different package or module than expected. Given that this method is part of the Nimbus class, it is likely involved in the cleanup process of topology IDs, which may be related to the heartbeat mechanism.\n\nNext, I will analyze the `Nimbus.doCleanup` method to see how it interacts with the `topoIdsToClean` method and contributes to the exceptions.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: \"org.apache.storm.daemon.nimbus.Nimbus.doCleanup\"  ",
            "The method `Nimbus.doCleanup` also could not be found in the codebase. This suggests that it may be similarly absent or located in a different part of the codebase. However, based on the context provided in the stack trace, it is likely that this method is responsible for performing cleanup operations related to the Nimbus service, which may include handling heartbeat messages and managing topology states.\n\nSince I have gathered sufficient information about the relevant methods leading to the exceptions, I can summarize the findings.\n\nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: The exceptions in the stack trace indicate a `PacemakerConnectionException` due to a timeout while waiting for a channel to be ready, likely caused by network issues, misconfiguration, or problems with the Pacemaker service. This leads to a `NullPointerException` when subsequent methods attempt to access data that was never retrieved due to the failed connection. The methods involved in this process include `waitUntilReady`, `send`, `sendAll`, and `get_worker_hb_children`, which all contribute to the failure to establish a connection and retrieve necessary data."

This could happen if the `stats` map contains a `Long` value instead of a `Map<K, V>` for one of its keys. \n\nTo further investigate, I need to look at the method that calls `filterSysStreams` to see how the `stats` map is constructed and what values it contains.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: 'org.apache.storm.stats.StatsUtil.aggPreMergeCompPageBolt'  \n",

This means that if the value associated with the `STATS` key in the `beat` map is not a `Map`, it will be returned as is, potentially leading to the `ClassCastException` when it is later cast to a `Map` in the `getMapByKey` method.\n\nTo further investigate how the `beat` map is constructed and what values it contains, I need to look at the context in which the `aggPreMergeCompPageBolt` method is called or how the `beat` map is populated.

It calls `getMapByKey(beat, STATS)` to get the statistics, which is then used to populate various output statistics. \n\nThe critical part is that the method uses `windowSetConverter` to convert the statistics, which may not guarantee that the values returned are of type `Map`. If any of the statistics (like `ACKED`, `FAILED`, `EMITTED`, or `TRANSFERRED`) are not `Map` types, this could lead to the `ClassCastException` when they are cast to `Map` in the `filterSysStreams` method.\n\nTo further investigate, I need to look at the `windowSetConverter` method to understand what it does and what types it returns.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: 'org.apache.storm.stats.StatsUtil.windowSetConverter'  \n",

It constructs a new map where the keys are transformed, and the values are expected to be maps as well. However, if any of the values in the original `stats` map are not of type `Map`, this will lead to a `ClassCastException` when attempting to cast them to `Map` in the `windowSetConverter` method.\n\nGiven that the `ClassCastException` is occurring when a `Long` is being cast to a `Map`, it is likely that one of the statistics being processed (like `ACKED`, `FAILED`, `EMITTED`, or `TRANSFERRED`) contains a `Long` value instead of a `Map`. This could happen if the data being fed into the `beat` map is not structured correctly or if there is an inconsistency in the data types being used.\n\nTo summarize, the root cause of the `ClassCastException` is likely due to the `beat` map containing a `Long` value for one of the keys that is expected to be a `Map`. This can happen during the population of the `beat` map, particularly in the methods that aggregate or transform the statistics.\n\nFinal Answer: The `ClassCastException` occurs because a `Long` value is being passed where a `Map` is expected, likely due to incorrect data being populated in the `beat` map, particularly under the `STATS` key. This can happen if the data structure is not consistent or if the statistics are not being aggregated correctly."

If `ConsList` cannot be modified to implement this interface, I could consider using a different data structure that is serializable or creating a wrapper class that implements `Serializable` and contains a `ConsList` instance.\n\nAdditionally, I could look into the serialization mechanism being used (in this case, Kryo) to see if there are any specific configurations or serializers that can handle `ConsList` objects.\n\nAction: Analyze and Request Next  \nAction Input: \"Investigate Kryo serialization and its handling of non-serializable classes\"  ",

This would involve extending the Kryo class and overriding the serialization methods to handle `ConsList` objects appropriately.\n\nAnother option is to check if there are existing serializers in the Kryo library that can handle collections or specific types of objects that might be compatible with `ConsList`.\n\nSince I cannot access specific methods or classes directly, I will summarize the general strategies for resolving the serialization issue.\n\nAction: Analyze and Request Next  \nAction Input: \"Summarize strategies for handling NotSerializableException in Java\"  ",

However, I can still provide general strategies for handling the `NotSerializableException` in Java, especially in the context of serialization with Kryo.\n\n1. **Implement Serializable**: Ensure that the `ConsList` class implements the `Serializable` interface. This is the most straightforward solution if you have control over the class.\n\n2. **Custom Serializer**: If modifying `ConsList` is not an option, create a custom serializer for it by extending the Kryo class. Override the `write` and `read` methods to define how `ConsList` should be serialized and deserialized.\n\n3. **Wrapper Class**: Create a wrapper class that implements `Serializable` and contains an instance of `ConsList`. This way, you can serialize the wrapper instead of `ConsList` directly.\n\n4. **Use Alternative Data Structures**: If possible, consider using a different data structure that is already serializable, such as `ArrayList` or `LinkedList`, instead of `ConsList`.\n\n5. **Kryo Configuration**: Check Kryo's configuration options to see if there are built-in serializers that can handle the type of data you are working with. Kryo has a flexible serialization mechanism that might allow you to register custom serializers for specific classes.\n\n6. **Debugging Serialization**: Use logging or debugging to identify which objects are being serialized and ensure that all nested objects also implement `Serializable` or have appropriate serializers.\n\nSince I cannot access specific methods or classes directly, I will summarize the general strategies for resolving the serialization issue.\n\nFinal Answer: To resolve the `NotSerializableException` for `org.apache.storm.trident.tuple.ConsList`, consider the following strategies: implement the `Serializable` interface in `ConsList`, create a custom serializer for it using Kryo, use a wrapper class that is serializable, switch to a different data structure, or explore Kryo's configuration options for handling serialization."

The second is an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, which indicates that the code is trying to access an invalid index in an array or list.\n\nTo better understand the context and potential causes of these exceptions, I need to analyze the methods involved in the stack traces, particularly focusing on the `getComponentPageInfo` method in the Nimbus class, as it appears in both traces.\n\nAction: Analyze and Request Next  \nAction Input: \"Analyze the `getComponentPageInfo` method in the Nimbus class to understand its implementation and how it might lead to the exceptions observed.\"  ",

            "The `getComponentPageInfo` method in the Nimbus class is responsible for retrieving information about a specific component in a topology. It takes parameters such as `topology_id`, `component_id`, `window`, and a boolean `is_include_sys`, along with a callback for asynchronous processing. The method first checks if the Nimbus instance is ready to process requests and then creates a new call object (`getComponentPageInfo_call`) to handle the request asynchronously.\n\nGiven that this method is involved in both stack traces, it is crucial to understand how it interacts with the Thrift transport layer and how it might lead to the exceptions observed.\n\nNext, I need to analyze the `getComponentPageInfo_call` class to see how it processes the request and if there are any potential issues that could lead to the `TTransportException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: \"org.apache.storm.daemon.nimbus.Nimbus.getComponentPageInfo_call\"  ",

Specifically, I should look for any methods that handle the response or any related classes that deal with the transport layer.\n\nAction: Analyze and Request Next  \nAction Input: \"Analyze the surrounding context of the `getComponentPageInfo` method in the Nimbus class, including any related methods or classes that might handle the request or response.\"  ",

            "It appears that I am unable to retrieve specific methods or classes from the Nimbus class or its related components. This could be due to limitations in accessing the codebase or the methods being part of a different structure.\n\nGiven the context of the exceptions, I should consider the following:\n\n1. **TTransportException**: This typically indicates a problem with the Thrift transport layer, which could be due to network issues, misconfiguration, or the server being unavailable. It is essential to check the network connectivity and the configuration of the Thrift server.\n\n2. **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException**: This suggests that the code is trying to access an invalid index in an array or list. This could happen if the list is empty or if the index being accessed is out of bounds. It would be beneficial to check how the `getComponentPageInfo` method processes the input parameters and how it interacts with any lists or arrays.\n\nSince I cannot access the specific methods or classes directly, I will summarize the potential causes of the exceptions based on the information I have:\n\n- **Network Issues**: Ensure that the Thrift server is running and accessible from the client. Check for any firewall rules or network configurations that might block the connection.\n\n- **Input Validation**: Review the input parameters being passed to the `getComponentPageInfo` method. Ensure that the `topology_id` and `component_id` are valid and that the corresponding component exists in the topology.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling in the code to gracefully manage cases where the requested component information is not available, which could prevent the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nFinal Answer: The exceptions indicate a potential issue with the Thrift transport layer (TTransportException) and an invalid index access in an array or list (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException). To resolve these, check network connectivity, validate input parameters, and improve error handling in the code."

            "I have been analyzing the methods related to blob retrieval in Apache Storm to understand the cause of the `WrappedKeyNotFoundException`. The analysis has focused on several key methods involved in the process of retrieving blobs associated with a specific topology. \n\nThe key observations so far include:\n\n1. **Blob Retrieval Process**: The methods `getStoredBlobMeta`, `getBlob`, `readBlob`, and `readBlobTo` are all part of the blob retrieval process. The `WrappedKeyNotFoundException` indicates that the system is unable to find the required blobs (both the storm code and the storm jar) for the specified topology.\n\n2. **Missing Blobs**: The repeated occurrence of the `WrappedKeyNotFoundException` suggests that the blobs may not exist in the local file system or that there is a misconfiguration preventing their retrieval. This could be due to the blobs being deleted, not being uploaded correctly, or issues with the blob store configuration.\n\n3. **Next Steps**: I attempted to analyze additional methods in the Nimbus class that are involved in managing topologies and their dependencies, but I encountered methods that were not found in the codebase. This indicates that I may need to focus on the existing methods that have been analyzed and consider the overall context of the blob store and topology management.\n\nGiven the current understanding, I will summarize the findings and provide a final answer regarding the cause of the `WrappedKeyNotFoundException`.\n\nFinal Answer: The `WrappedKeyNotFoundException` in Apache Storm indicates that the system is unable to find the required blobs (storm code and storm jar) for the specified topology. This is likely due to the blobs being missing from the local file system, possibly because they were not uploaded correctly, were deleted, or there is a misconfiguration in the blob store. Further investigation into the blob storage configuration and the process of uploading blobs is recommended to resolve this issue."

The `consumeBatchToCursor` method retrieves objects from a buffer and logs an error if an object is null, but it does not prevent the null object from being passed to the handler.\n\nTo further investigate, I should check how the buffer is populated and whether there are any checks in place to ensure that valid data is being added to the buffer.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: 'backtype.storm.utils.DisruptorQueue.get'  ",

If this byte array is null, it will throw a `NullPointerException`.\n\n2. **Event Handling in DisruptorQueue**: The `consumeBatchToCursor` method retrieves objects from a buffer and checks if they are null. If an object is null, it logs an error but does not prevent the null object from being passed to the handler, which can lead to the `NullPointerException` during deserialization.\n\n3. **Buffer Population**: The root cause of the null values in the buffer needs to be investigated. Since I cannot access the methods that populate the buffer, I cannot definitively identify how null values are being introduced.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the following steps could be taken:\n\n- **Check Buffer Population**: Investigate the parts of the code responsible for adding elements to the buffer in `DisruptorQueue`. Ensure that null checks are in place before adding elements.\n\n- **Add Null Checks**: Implement checks in the `consumeBatchToCursor` method to prevent null objects from being passed to the handler.\n\n- **Debugging**: Add logging or debugging statements to trace the flow of data into the buffer to identify where null values are being introduced.\n\nFinal Answer: The `NullPointerException` is likely caused by a null byte array being passed to the `deserialize` method in `KryoTupleDeserializer`, which is triggered by null objects being retrieved from the buffer in `DisruptorQueue`.

However, I can still provide some general insights into the `TTransportException` and its potential causes based on common knowledge of Apache Storm and Thrift.\n\nThe `TTransportException` typically occurs due to issues such as:\n\n1. **Network Issues**: Problems with the network connection between the client and server can lead to this exception. This could be due to firewalls, network outages, or incorrect network configurations.\n\n2. **Server Unavailability**: If the server that the client is trying to connect to is down or not reachable, this exception may be thrown.\n\n3. **Misconfiguration**: Incorrect configuration settings in the Storm topology or Thrift client can also lead to transport exceptions. This includes incorrect hostnames, ports, or protocol settings.\n\n4. **Timeouts**: If the client does not receive a response from the server within a specified timeout period, it may throw a `TTransportException`.\n\n5. **Protocol Mismatch**: If there is a mismatch in the expected protocol between the client and server, this can also result in a transport exception.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can:\n\n- Check the network connectivity between the client and server.\n- Ensure that the server is running and accessible.\n- Review the configuration settings for the Storm topology and Thrift client.\n- Look into the logs for any additional error messages that might provide more context.\n\nSince I couldn't find specific methods to analyze further, I will conclude my response here.\n\nThought: I now know the final answer.\nFinal Answer: The `org.apache.storm.thrift.transport.TTransportException` typically indicates issues with the transport layer in Apache Storm's Thrift communication, often due to network problems, server unavailability, misconfiguration, timeouts, or protocol mismatches.

The `Utils` class provides a method `handleUncaughtException` that can help manage such exceptions by logging them and handling specific cases like `OutOfMemoryError`.

The SPN should be correctly registered in the Kerberos database.\n\n2. **Misconfigured Kerberos Configuration**: Check the `krb5.conf` file for correct realm and KDC settings. Ensure that the KDC is reachable and properly configured.\n\n3. **DNS Issues**: Kerberos relies heavily on DNS. Ensure that the hostname used in the SPN resolves correctly to the service's IP address.\n\n4. **Expired or Invalid Tickets**: Verify that the Kerberos tickets are valid and not expired. You can use the `klist` command to check the current tickets.\n\n5. **Key Distribution Center (KDC) Issues**: Ensure that the KDC is functioning correctly and that there are no network issues preventing access to it.\n\n6. **Client and Server Time Synchronization**: Kerberos requires that the client and server clocks are synchronized.

Common causes include incorrect SPN configuration, misconfigured Kerberos settings, DNS issues, expired or invalid tickets, KDC issues, and time synchronization problems. To resolve this, ensure the SPN is correct, check the `krb5.conf` file, verify DNS resolution, check ticket validity, ensure the KDC is functioning, and synchronize client and server clocks."

This is evident from the error message indicating that the `writerIndex` plus the minimum writable bytes exceeds the `maxCapacity` of the buffer.\n\nTo further understand the state management issue, I need to look at methods related to the initialization and starting of instances, particularly in the `CuratorFrameworkImpl` class, as the `IllegalStateException` suggests that an instance must be started before calling certain methods.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: \"org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CuratorFrameworkImpl.start\"  ",

This indicates that the buffer management is not handling the data size correctly, leading to an attempt to write beyond its capacity.\n\n2. **IllegalStateException**: This exception indicates that the `CuratorFrameworkImpl` instance must be started before calling certain methods, such as `checkExists`. This suggests that there is a missing initialization step in the code where the `CuratorFramework` is being used.\n\nTo resolve these issues, the following steps can be taken:\n\n- **For the EncoderException**: Review the logic that determines the size of the data being written to the buffer. Ensure that the buffer is allocated with sufficient capacity to handle the expected data size.\n\n- **For the IllegalStateException**: Ensure that the `CuratorFramework` instance is properly started before any method calls that require it to be in a started state. This typically involves calling a `start()` method on the `CuratorFramework` instance after it has been created.\n\nSince I cannot retrieve more specific methods or documentation directly, I recommend checking the Apache Storm documentation or source code for examples of how to properly initialize and use the `CuratorFramework`.\n\nFinal Answer: The exceptions indicate issues with buffer management (writing beyond capacity) and state management (not starting the CuratorFramework instance). To resolve these, ensure proper buffer size allocation and that the CuratorFramework instance is started before use."

The `_userRsrc` map not containing the user, leading to `lrsrcSet` being `null`.\n2. The `localResource.getBlobName()` method returning `null`, which could cause issues when trying to access the `lrsrcSet`.\n3. The `getClientBlobStore()` method returning `null`, although this is less likely since it is assigned to `blobstore` and checked before shutdown.\n\nNext, I need to analyze the `updateBlobsForTopology` method in the `UpdateBlobs` class to see how it interacts with the `updateBlobs` method and if it could contribute to the `NullPointerException`.\n\nAction: Provide Method  \nAction Input: \"org.apache.storm.daemon.supervisor.timer.UpdateBlobs.updateBlobsForTopology\"  ",

The `topoConf` map not containing the `Config.TOPOLOGY_BLOBSTORE_MAP` key, resulting in `blobstoreMap` being `null`.\n3. The `blobstoreMap` being empty or improperly formatted, which could lead to issues when converting it to `localresources`.\n\nGiven that both methods have potential points of failure that could lead to a `NullPointerException`, it is important to ensure that the inputs to these methods are valid and properly initialized.\n\nNext, I will analyze the context in which `updateBlobsForTopology` is called to see if there are any additional factors that could contribute to the `NullPointerException`.\n\nAction: Analyze and Request Next  \nAction Input: \"Analyze the context in which `updateBlobsForTopology` is called to identify potential issues.\"  ",

The configuration maps (`conf` and `topoConf`) are properly populated before being passed to these methods.\n2. The user and blob resources are correctly initialized and not `null`.\n\nTo summarize, the `NullPointerException` could arise from:\n- Missing or improperly initialized user resources in `_userRsrc`.\n- Invalid or missing configuration data in the `conf` map.\n- Issues with the blobstore map being empty or not formatted correctly.\n\nFinal Answer: The `NullPointerException` in the provided stack trace likely occurs due to missing or improperly initialized resources in the `updateBlobs` and `updateBlobsForTopology` methods.

In the context of Nimbus, this could be due to missing or improperly configured supervisor details or other dependencies that Nimbus relies on.\n\n2. **Leadership Issues**: The error indicating \"not a leader\" suggests that the Nimbus instance is trying to perform an operation that is restricted to the leader node in a distributed setup. This could happen if:\n   - The Nimbus instance has lost its leadership status due to a failure or network partition.\n   - There is a misconfiguration in the cluster setup, leading to multiple instances trying to act as leaders.\n\n3. **Event Processing Errors**: The halting of the process due to an error while processing an event could be a result of the above issues, where Nimbus is unable to handle incoming requests properly due to its state.\n\nIn conclusion, the exceptions in the stack trace point to issues with leadership and object initialization within the Nimbus component of Apache Storm. To resolve these issues, one would typically check the configuration of the Storm cluster, ensure that all nodes are properly communicating, and verify that the necessary objects are initialized before use.\n\nFinal Answer: The stack trace indicates multiple `RuntimeException` errors in Apache Storm's Nimbus component, primarily due to a `NullPointerException`, leadership issues, and event processing errors. These may stem from uninitialized objects or misconfigurations in the distributed system."

            "Description": "The Nimbus component of Apache Storm is encountering multiple RuntimeExceptions during startup, leading to a forced halt and subsequent leadership confusion. The primary issue appears to be a NullPointerException occurring in the Nimbus class, specifically during the execution of methods related to supervisor details and scheduler assignments. This situation is exacerbated by the Nimbus instance failing to assert its leadership status, which is critical in a distributed system where only the leader can perform certain operations.",
