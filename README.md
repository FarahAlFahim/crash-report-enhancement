## Project overview

This repository contains three top-level folders:

- `data/` — dataset files (raw or processed crash reports, repository snapshots, graph-store, etc.)
- `results/` — outputs produced by experiments (enhanced reports, evaluation tables, logs)
- `scripts/` — runnable scripts to preprocess data, run experiments, and evaluate results
